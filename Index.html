           Artificial intelligence has been a necessity for the next evolution for humanity, and maybe one of the causes of its extinction.
 We have to consider that it's the normal next development for our civilization. Artificial intelligence is an idea of making a different kind of brain - a computer brain -
 that can take decisions and think creatively and have the ability to learn and a mobility to adapt.
 This page is about artificial intelligence’s history, development, and some of its applications.everyday influences of artificial intelligence are altering the way our daily lives look.
 If someone from the 1950s travelled through time and arrived in 2019, they would marvel at the way we use our smartphones to navigate around town,
 how virtual digital assistants such as Alexa and Cortana respond to our queries and would be baffled by our addiction to social media channels
 such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. What is now normal to us and powered by AI, would be utterly foreign to our friend from the past.
 There's no doubt that artificial intelligence is an integral part of our daily lives.
