                      <td>The AI field goes back to the 1940s. This concept grew academically in the 1950s and through government-sponsored projects in the 1960s.
 Finally, funding eventually died in the 1970s.The next phase was in the 1980s, when AI techniques moved from academic applications to the business world.
 During this time, it was discovered that AI could be used to predict stock prices in order to solve more complex business problems.
In the 80's and 90's, robotics entered factories, showing the potential for machines to completely change the industry.
 As a result, it created fear and backlash against AI technology, slowing its growth again.</td>
                 
                     <td>In recent years, we have seen a significant surge in Artificial Intelligence technologies, such as
 robotics for surgery and the third generation of AI â€“ The Age of Deep Learning. We can therefore see innovation happening at a fast pace,
 with leaders like Google using deep learning algorithms to create predictive models.
In addition, many scale applications are already being used by AI. Vacuum cleaners, smart cars, self-driving cars,
 personal assistant robots are the most common examples.
These are representative of the uses of AI today, and we regularly see new milestones in AI technology.</td>
                 
                     <td>In the future , AI will continue to grow in a way that will allow for new business models and functionalities.
It will also play a key role in improving the quality of life by enabling people to perform tasks more efficiently and in less time.
Although we can not be sure of the exact future, it is quite clear that interaction with AI will soon become a day-to-day activity.
 These interactions could help our society to develop, particularly in terms of automated transport, addressing climate change and improving
 care for the elderly. Beyond these few impacts, there are even more ways AI technology can influence our future.</td>
