            The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in the old ages, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by This work . it got to its highest limits
 in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract of mathematical reasoning.<br/> This device and the ideas behind it inspired the scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.
The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.
Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods.<br/> In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning.
Investment and interest in AI prospered in the first decades of the 21st century, when machine learning was successfully applied to many problems in academia and industry due to new methods, the application of powerful computer hardware, and the collection of immense data sets.
