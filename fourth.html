                         AI has mutiple applications on a lot of fields and its usage is increasing rapidly.<br/>
                               As time passes artificial intelligence is becoming more effective<br/>
                                  and more powerful and that makes it more usable<br/>
                                         in different applications<br/>
                                                 such as:-
               <p/>

     

       <ul style="font-size:130%;color:white;">
                  <li>Artificial business intelligence:<br/>
                      Robotic process automation is applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans.<br/>
                      Machine learning algorithms are integrated into analytics and Customer Relationship Management<br/>
                      platforms to uncover information on how to better serve clients. Chatbots have already been incorporated<br/>
                      into websites and e-companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of employment positions<br/>
                      has also become a point of discussion between academics and IT consultants.</li><br/>

                  <li>AI in education:<br/>
                      it automates grading, giving more time to educators.<br/>
                      It can also assess and adjust students to their needs , allowing them to function at their own pace.</li><br/>

                  <li>AI for robotics:<br/>
                      will allow us to face the needs of the elderly and to encourage a much longer independence.<br/>
                      It will reduce significantly, also decrease road accidents and deaths and encourage disasters<br/>
                      to respond to threats, e.g. the nuclear meltdown of the Fukushima plant.</li><br/>
